ðŸ§  **Triglyceride Level Prediction Using Machine Learning**
A predictive machine learning model that estimates triglyceride levels based on demographic, physiological, and lifestyle data from 22,401 individuals.
This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow â€” from preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

ðŸ“Š**Project Overview**
Cardiovascular health depends on early detection of abnormal lipid levels. This project builds a regression-based model to predict triglyceride concentration using clinical and lifestyle variables such as:
Age, gender, and BMI
Blood pressure and cholesterol levels
Liver enzyme concentrations (ALT, AST, GGT)
Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise)

ðŸš€ **Key Features**


âœ… Cleaned and preprocessed real-world medical dataset (22K+ samples)

âœ… Built a Linear Regression model optimised via Gradient Descent

âœ… Applied ColumnTransformer for efficient scaling and encoding
